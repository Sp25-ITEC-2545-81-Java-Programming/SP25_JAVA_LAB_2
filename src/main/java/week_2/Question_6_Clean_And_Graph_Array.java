 When collecting data, it's common to get some bad data mixed in with the actual data.
 
 For this program, imagine that you are monitoring your internet speed once an hour.
 Sometimes the connection is lost completely. Due to a bug in the monitoring program,
 when the connection is lost, the speed is recorded as 2,147,483,647 Mbps, (mega bits per second)
 which is much too fast to be a valid speed.
 
 1-20 Mbps is typical for an average budget home cable internet connection. Fiber connections may be 1000Mbs or 1 gigabit.
 
 ( Question - what's special about 2,147,483,647? Why might the monitoring program record this number in particular? )
 
 Part 1: In this program, complete the cleanData method to remove bad data from an array of data.
 A value of 2147483647 means the connection was lost, then 0 bytes were transferred.
 So, replace each 2147483647 values in the array with 0.
 
 Part 2: Complete the graphData method to draw a basic vertical graph of the data.

        // This doesn't work with int or String values, so there will be many time where you will need to return a value.

        For the first element in the array, print that number of stars on a line.
        For the second element in the array, print that element's value of stars on a new line.
        
        Example: if the array was { 4, 5, 3, 2, 5 }
        Then print the following. Notice the first line has 4 stars, the second line has 5 stars,
        the third line has 3 stars...

        If your computer takes a really long time to run this method, or is drawing a lot of stars,
        or crashes with an OutOfMemoryError,
        you may not have removed the very large numbers from
        the array. Make sure you've replaced the 2147483647 values with 0 in the array.
        Press the red stop button in the Run window to stop your program.
        
        Make sure this method works with any length array.
