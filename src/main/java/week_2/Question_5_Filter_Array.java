 Write a program that prints only the program file names from an array.
 
 For this question, a program file is any file that ends with .py or .java or .cs
 
 For example, if a filenames array  = { "lab1.py", "assignment.docx", "music.mp3", "Website.cs", "Calculator.java" }
 Then the program should print
 
 lab1.py
 Website.cs
 Calculator.java
