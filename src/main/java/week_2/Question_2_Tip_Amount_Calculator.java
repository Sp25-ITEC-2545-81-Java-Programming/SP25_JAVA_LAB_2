/**
 
 Write a program that prints suggested tip amounts for a food check in a restaurant.
 
 The user will enter the amount of the check.
 
 The program will print the amount of tip for various percentages.
 
 It will print a table of suggested tip amounts from 10% to 30%, in 5% increments.
 
 For example, if the user has a check of $30, the program will print
 
10% tip $3.00 total $33.00
15% tip $4.50 total $34.50
20% tip $6.00 total $36.00
25% tip $7.50 total $37.50
30% tip $9.00 total $39.00
 
 Format the numbers to 2 decimal places.
 
 Your program's output should look exactly as shown above.
